Running the slow program
------------------------

Q: What is the complexity of findSimilarity?
Answer in terms of N, the total number of 5-grams in the input files.
Assume that the number of 5-grams that occur in more than one file is a small
constant - that is, there is not much plagiarised text.

A:

Q: How long did the program take on the 'small' and 'medium' directories?
Is the ratio between the times what you would expect, given the complexity?
Explain very briefly why.

A:

Q: How long do you predict the program would take to run on the 'huge'
directory?

A:

Using binary search trees
-------------------------

Q: Which of the trees usually become unbalanced?

A:

Q (optional): Is there a simple way to stop these trees becoming unbalanced?

A (optional): 

Using scapegoat trees
---------------------

Q: Now what is the total complexity of buildIndex and findSimilarity?
Again, assume a total of N 5-grams, and a constant number of 5-grams that
occur in more than one file.

A:

Q (optional): What if the total similarity score is an arbitrary number S,
rather than a small constant?

A (optional):

Q (optional): Did you find any text that was clearly copied?

A (optional):
